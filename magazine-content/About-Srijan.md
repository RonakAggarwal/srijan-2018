Srijan.
Srijan means creation.
Srijan is the annual magazine of Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi.
Launched every year at Sankalan.

Srijan started with an aim to capture the infinite advancements in technology and lay out a bigger picture in a few words.
Since then, we have been trying to capture and highlight what happened in the past year and what lies ahead.
Srijan aims at giving a complete roundup of the emerging tech within the field of computer science.

Previous versions of the magazine also some ART, as we believe programming is an ART.
And one who can program is an Artist at heart.

The theme for this year's srijan is CES 2018

CES is huge, and it matters.
CES or the Consumer Electronics Show is the largest yearly show in Las Vegas. 
Interestingly, CES is about twice the size of Mobile World Congress.
CES has evolved to show us that what seems awkward and “for rich lazy people” one year, 
becomes reasonable, practical, and available to everyone seemingly overnight.
CES is all about showing us how everyday life will get better next year or the year later.
CES encompasses and touches nearly everything we do every day. 

A few major topics this year were
Alexa & other voice assistants.
Hey google
