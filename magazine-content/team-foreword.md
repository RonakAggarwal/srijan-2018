The Editorial Team of Srijan takes immense pleasure to present the eighth edition of our Annual Tech Magazine 'SRIJAN'. 
Listing all the technological advancements is itself a task in this ever-evolving world of technologies. This year we tried to capture the Consumer Electronics Show.
CES is one stop platform to capture all the new developments in the field of technology.
From a pool of topics, we tried to cover some of the exciting ones.
Artificial intelligence, 5G Technology, Smart home devices, Virtual Reality, Drones, Neuromorphic Computing, Containerization, and more.
Essentially, you get all the new advancements in the form of curated articles at one place. Apart from the technology, you'll find glimpses of the thoughts of this generation on the recent technological advancements happening across the globe.
