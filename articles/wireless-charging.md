# WIRELESS CHARGING
 
Wireless charging technology has been around for more than 100 years, but its inclusion in devices of Apple's new iPhone series line has given it a new life.
 
Wireless charging uses an electromagnetic field to transfer charge between two objects by electromagnetic induction. This is mostly done with the use of charging station.
PowerbyProxi was founded in 2007 by entrepreneur Fady Mishriki as a spin-out from the University of Auckland. PowerByProxi has showcased charging boxes and bowls into which multiple devices can be placed and charged simultaneously.
The Aukland-based company got its start selling large-scale systems for the construction, telecommunications, defence and agriculture industries. One such product is a wireless control system for wind turbines.
Wireless charging is dominantly used in the healthcare sector, automotive sector and manufacturing industries as it offers the promise of increased mobility and advances that allows tiny internet of things (IoT) devices to get power from distant charger (charger that is many feet away).
 
## Some advantages of wireless charging include:

- Protected connection
- Low infection risk
- Durability
- Autonomous driving technology
- Automated high power inductive charging
- Integration

## Some disadvantages of wireless charging include:
- Compatibility
- Performance
- Less efficient

The most visible and significant use of wireless charging technology has been in mobile device charging pads, charging pads for electric cars, warehouse robots to tiny IoT devices, military, healthcare sector that would otherwise need to be wired or powered by replaceable batteries.

Wireless charging is though very convenient and making our lives easier.
