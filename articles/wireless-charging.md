# WIRELESS CHARGING
 
Wireless charging technology has been around for more than 100 years, but its inclusion in devices such as Apple's new iPhone line has given it new life. 
 
Wireless charging has been around since the late 19th century, when electricity pioneer Nikola Tesla demonstrated magnetic resonant coupling â€“ the ability to transmit electricity through the air by creating a magnetic field between two circuits, a transmitter and a receiver.
Wireless charging is making inroads in the healthcare, automotive and manufacturing industries because it offers the promise of increased mobility and advances that could allow tiny internet of things (IoT) devices to get power many feet away from a charger.
PowerbyProxi was founded in 2007 by entrepreneur Fady Mishriki as a spin-out from the University of Auckland. PowerByProxi has showcased charging boxes and bowls into which multiple devices can be placed and charged at the same time.
The Aukland-based company got its start selling large-scale systems for the construction, telecommunications, defence and agriculture industries. One such product is a wireless control system for wind turbines.


While the most visible use of wireless charging technology has been in mobile device charging pads, the technology is also making inroads into everything from warehouse robots to tiny IoT devices that otherwise would need to be wired or powered by replaceable batteries.
