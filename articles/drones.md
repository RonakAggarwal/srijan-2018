Drones or the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. You might have seen a drone for capturing videos, but are these tiny flyers limited to just that? The answer is ‘NO’, there’s a bigger picture to it. Drones have a potential that is hard to overstate and there is no end when it comes to their possibilities and conceivable outcomes. The drone technology is constantly evolving as new innovation and we are at the beginning of a drone revolution. 

Drones have been most commonly associated with military, traffic and weather monitoring and now, they have stepped into other areas of human life. They can change the way in which things and people are transported, deliver food and medicine to the people who need it and can also help in search and rescue operations. In 2013, Amazon had announced its idea of using drones for delivery in the future, and now this idea is not far from becoming a reality! 

The first drones were built during the First World War and were used for target practice and training. Then, Drones began to be deployed for other roles, acting acting as decoys in combat, launching missiles against fixed targets, and more. 
Now, the focus is on monitoring climate change, carrying out search operations after a natural disaster and distributing rations as needed, photography, surveillance in areas where troops cannot safely go and monitoring crops using drones. Because of the ability of these miniature flying objects to take over the world, Drones have been a dominant topic in CES since 2016. This year at CES, after the first day ended, Intel launched
its fleet of 250 shooting star drones in the sky. The fleet was programmed using Intel's animation software, and the entire show was controlled using a single pilot. That's a milestone in itself. The idea was to use the sky as a 3D canvas and show the world an amalgamation of technology and art.

Now, let’s look at some of the exciting drones.

## VOLOCOPTER
It is an autonomous flying machine that can take two passengers from one place to another. This 18-rotor air taxi drone made its debut flight at CES 2018 and thus, making the idea of “flying cars” a reality. 

## AIR SELFIE 2
Air Selfie 2 is a perfect gadget for the selfie addicts! The original Air selfie launched at CES 2016, but now the company is back with an all new and improved version. It has upgraded from 5 to 12 megapixels, increased the camera’s field of view to 85 degrees, and improved the battery life by 50 percent.

## POWER DOLPHIN
It is an airborne drone that can move across the surface of a pond or lake and take videos and photos as it goes. Not only this, it can also deliver lifebelts to struggling swimmer and due to its built-in sonar scanning technology, it is able to detect fish from a distance of 131 feet making your fishing trips a less hands-on experience.

## TELLO
It is a toy drone that both kids and adults would love to fly. It packs a boatload of features and functionalities like its 360 degree camera, Intel vision processing chip, flight stabilization and a decent battery life.  

## YUNEEC TYPHOON H+
It is a device for those who are serious about drone photography. It boasts a 20 MP sensor in its camera, a high aperture lens and the ability to record a 4K video at 60 FPS with automatic obstacle avoidance.
