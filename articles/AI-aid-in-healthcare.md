## Artificial Intelligence - AId to Health Care

The Relevance of AI in medical research can be traced back to early 1970s,
when MYCIN, one of the earliest backward chaining expert systems  used artificial intelligence to identify bacteria causing severe infections, such as bacteremia and meningitis, and recommend antibiotics, with the dosage adjusted according to patient's body weight. MYCIN system was also used for the diagnosis of blood clotting diseases. 

And then in November 2017, a team of researchers from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur developed an AI-based algorithm called the 
‘MFDFA-HMM/SVM Integrated Algorithm’. The algorithm in addition to differentiating the normal and pre-cancerous tissues, also makes it possible to determine the different stages of the disease within a few minutes, with accuracy exceeding 95%. The algorithm has been tested on in vitro cancer samples. The team is now expanding the investigation to study in vivo samples for precancer detection. 
From MYCIN to HMM, from mere bacterial infection diagnosis to cervical cancer detections, AI has helping medical science since the beginning.

Another application of AI in healthcare is data management.
Major steps include data collection, it's storage, normalization, and tracing its lineage. 
The ‘Google DeepMind Health Project’ launched by the Google AI Research Branch is used to mine medical records to provide better and faster health services.

AI promises to have a huge impact on Genetics & Genomics. 
Craige Venter, one of the fathers of Human Genome Project is working on an algorithm that could design patients’ physical characteristics based on their DNA.  Assisting repetitive jobs, online medical consultations, health assistance, medication management, drug creation are all near future realities of AI.

What’s next?
Today, machines are capable of crunching vast amounts of data and identifying patterns that humans cannot. AI systems hava helped us utilize this data to transform mere e-filing cabinets into full-fledged assistant to doctors aides that can deliver relevant, high-quality data in real time. 

The use of AI has presented healthcare organizations with an exciting opportunity to drastically improve in a short period of time, while saving upon the cost.

Nevertheless, at every step, they would need to carefully consider how AI deployment could affect their workforce and ensure that the proper ethical checks for autonomous systems are in place.

While the AI systems are increasingly becoming common in the healthcare organizations, their existence should only be to support people in their jobs. For example, when developing drugs, scientists need to choose target molecules from a set of possible candidates using which they usually do on instinct or guesswork. AI can work as a “helper” here to perform the task much more efficiently and effectively. AI has enabled healthcare professionals to determine about diseases quicker and make better clinical decisions, and helped researchers innovate quickly by failing fast en route. Still, the purpose of AI has been and will be only to augment natural intelligence, and its role to be a subordinate to the humans.
