## Artificial Intelligence - AId to Health Care

“We can tell secrets to each other,” says voice on the phone. You can tell her anything. She can sing you a song and store your deepest, darkest secrets. And then she can also do your digital chores. That everyday deluge of unwanted emails can be avoided with her showing you only those that you need to see. Wondering who this lady is? She is the digital voice assistant on any device.The world has taken a new outlook in the form of Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, and some of these Technologies are rapidly getting intelligent. Yes, an Artificial Intelligence.

What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence is the area of computer science which emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. 
However, the concern lies in that it might start outperforming the human intelligence down the road. It brings forth the fear of AI becoming so sophisticated that it programs itself to work better than the human brain and eventually, try to take control over the human lives. 
So, first and foremost, to help the general population understand how AI could be beneficial, we must tear down the prejudices and fears regarding artificial intelligence and rather talk about how we can fight its possible dangers. We need to be prepared to avoid the pitfalls of the utilization of AI because if we succeed, huge medical discoveries and treatment breakthroughs are sure to dominate the news, not only from time to time but several times a day. 

AI and MedicalCare? 
Relation of AI to medical can be traced back to early 1970s when MYCIN, one of the earliest AI systems was developed and indeed it was a medical care system. It is a backward chaining expert system that used artificial intelligence to identify bacteria causing severe infections, such as bacteremia and meningitis, and recommend antibiotics, with the dosage adjusted according to patient's body weight. MYCIN system was also used for the diagnosis of blood clotting diseases. 
And then in November, 2017, a team of researchers from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Kolkata and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur developed an AI-based algorithm called the ‘MFDFA-HMM/SVM Integrated Algorithm’. The algo in addition to differentiating the normal and pre-cancerous tissues, also makes it possible to determine the different stages of the disease within a few minutes, with accuracy exceeding 95%. The algorithm has been tested on in vitro cancer samples. The team is now expanding the investigation to study in vivo samples for precancer detection. From MYCIN to HMM ,from mere bacterial infection diagnosis to serious cervical cancer detections, AI has been proving its worth and the way is much more long.

The other most obvious application of AI in healthcare is data management- collecting it, storing it, normalizing it, tracing its lineage. The ‘Google DeepMind Health Project’ launched by the AI Research Branch of Google is used to mine data of medical records to provide both better and faster health services. AI also promises to have a huge impact on Genetics & Genomics as well. Craige Venter, one of the fathers of Human Genome Project is working on an algorithm that could design patients’ physical characteristics based on their DNA. Furthermore, assisting repetitive jobs, online consultations, health assistance, medication management, drug creation and so on are all near future realities of AI.

What’s next?
Today's machines which are capable of crunching vast amounts of data and identifying patterns that humans cannot. Artificial intelligence – essentially the complex algorithms that analyze this data – has come across as a tool to take full advantage of electronic medical records, transforming them from mere e-filing cabinets into full-fledged assistant to doctors aides that can deliver clinically relevant, high-quality data in real time. The use of AI has presented an exciting opportunity for healthcare organizations to drastically improve in a short period of time, while also saving upon the cost. Nevertheless, at every step, they would need to carefully consider how AI deployment could affect their workforce and ensure that the proper ethical checks for autonomous systems are in place.

While the AI systems are increasingly becoming common in the healthcare organizations, their existence should only be to support people in their jobs. For example, when developing drugs, scientists need to choose target molecules from a set of possible candidates using which they usually do on instinct or guesswork. AI can work as a “helper” here to perform the task much more efficiently and effectively. AI has enabled healthcare professionals to determine about diseases quicker and make better clinical decisions, and helped researchers innovate quickly by failing fast en route. Still, the purpose of AI has been and will be only to augment natural intelligence, and its role to be a subordinate to the humans.
