A century ago, having a thought of being able to control a device from another smart device, and that too from another corner of the Earth was pure fiction. 
The evolution and innovation in technology took a leap soon after the industrial revolution, and the discovery that carbon like elements, like silicon, can be synthesized in labs, and manufactured in factories. 
Being able to break the strong covalent bonds in such elements and creating semiconductors chips led the way for one of the greatest economies, the silicon valley. 

The silicon valley is easily more than just a metro, proven by the fact that the amount of data available with the Fortune 500 companies is more than enough to affect the lives of almost anyone with an internet connection. With the power to impact the world population and an economy at par with an entire continent, the silicon valley attracts talent from around the world.
The founders of the big five, namely Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook were also a part of this influx of talent in the sector.

One of the reasons they became successful was because they were not deterred by failure. 
Facebook’s earlier version known as Facemash developed by Mark Zuckerberg in the Sophomore year in Harvard crashed of the servers in the campus, however, he was not suspended for doing so but only encouraged to come up with something better to attract the audiences. This very well highlights the importance of recognition and support required for the journey from a startup to a conglomerate.

This resilience goes well with good marketing.
Apple suffered multiple partitions over time, but even today remains the biggest company in the world. The credit goes to Steve Jobs, the man behind Apple. He introduced the concept of personal computers in the 1980s. This was a master strategy. Being able to project computers in the late 1980s as a commodity needed by every individual and projecting them as a sign of status was indeed a great achievement. 

Along with Marketing,  Innovation plays a key role.
But Marketing won't work unless you innovate. 
Apple is famous for its innovation and its revolutionary new technology. Apple introduced tech which was playful and user-friendly for everyone. They innovated the GUI and the mouse in Mackintosh. Mouse as an idea was available since 1960s however, was commercially viably brought under effective and user-friendly use by Jobs. Apple continues to innovate even now, which keeps it consistently at the top.

Technocratic entrepreneurialism is essential in today's ever competitive world. Innovation is now essential. Pathbreaking ideas capable of shaping and changing the lives of many is needed to multiply one’s startup in the market of commercial technology. 

Ideas as wild as self-driving cars, Automated Manufacturing from raw materials to finished goods, internet of things, and several others are finding their way in the real world with the advancements in technology. Amazingly, the innovations are not just limited to the billion-dollar companies. Startups worldwide are contributing their bit to build better systems and improving technology. Often enough, these startups need a platform to showcase their innovation. 
Such showcasing and promotion of associated businesses is done by the ‘Consumer Technology Association’ or the CTA whose landmark event, CES, The Consumer Electronics Show, annually becomes the center of attraction and showcase technologies from around the globe. 

The innovators meet entrepreneurs, technocrats intermingle with business outsourcers for their mutual benefit, and to provide something better to the world. 
The stage provides not just business promotion but helps innovators and developers learn from each other and gain much-needed exposure. 

If Zuckerberg can go from Facemash to Facebook, Steve Jobs can go from a startup to the largest tech company, one can only imagine what these startups can do in the 21st century after gaining a global exposure at such an early stage.

India as well needs such a stage to showcase the talent pool available to it. Forums and conclaves are needed for India to get
the technological exposure which it desperately awaits, as technology is the only solution to make
the management of an ever-growing 125 crore population seamless and free of chaos.
