## Technocratic Entrepreneurialism

About a century back in time having a thought of being able to control a device from another smart device from the other corner of the Earth was only a mention in wildest of fictions. Evolution
of technology took an exponential upliftment soon after the peak of industrial revolution In the US
and the breaking of the myth, at the same time, that carbon like elements such as silicon can be
synthesised by humans in the factories as well and not just only by natural phenomenas like
lightenings and volcanic eruptions. Being able to break the strong covalent bonds of such
elements and creating chips along with semiconductors made the pathway clear for an industry
as big as the economy of any big continent of the world ie. the silicon valley. The silicon valley is
easily more than just a metro, proven by the fact that the amount of data which is available in the
systems of fortune 500 is enough to define and affect the lives of almost the whole of humanity
who have any kind of device with an internet connection.
With such a vast impact on the world population and the scale of the economy involved in the
business attracts talent from around the world into the sector. The founders of the big five (Apple,
Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook) were also a part of this influx of talents in the sector.
Initial stage of these companies were as ordinary as a drop out or college student could be.
However the time favoured them. Getting a time in the history which would create demand as well
as well as a craze in the masses to extensively use the technology which would largely be making
these start ups multi billion dollar conglomerates in the future. But not just getting birth in the right
time at the right place was in their favour but also the fact that the failures, crashes of their
systems was not a deterring factor for them and luckily not even the ones who supported them.
Facebook’s earlier version known as Facemash developed by Mark Zuckerberg in the second
year of college in Harvard was responsible for crashing of the servers in the campus, however he
was not suspended for doing so but only encouraged to come up with something better and more
appealing to attract the audiences, we all know today how much Mark makes out of the
innovation and experiment which once crashed the servers in Harvard. Showing the importance of
recognition and support in the process of conversion from a small time developer or innovator to
a conglomerate is this example of Facebook.
Even more important essentially for a developer or techie is to get a platform or many a times
create one to market the goods and services which he intend to provide. Taking the example of
the person who would be an inspiration for not just the techies but the entrepreneurs as well that
too at the same time. Steve Jobs, the man behind a firm which even after multiple breaks ups and
partitioning of its conglomerate even today remains the biggest company in the world that too
with a significant margin from the nearest competitor. Like Pixar, which branched out in the initial
years of apple. Mackintosh introduced the concept of personal computers which was a master
strategy by Jobs, being able to project computers in late 1980s as a commodity needed by every
individual and was made a sign of status and necessity. Mackintosh sales were many folds higher
than the nearest competitors not just because of technology but the business strategy adopted
by the company. Another such innovation was the introduction of revolutionary new technology
which was playful and user friendly enough for every section of the society to enjoy, GUI and the
mouse in mackintosh. Mouse as an idea was available since 1960s however was commercially
viably brought under effective and user friendly use by Jobs, proving to be another innovation
which was supported by the company directors making the company even bigger.
Technocratic entrepreneurialism is essential in todays ever competitive world. Innovation is now
essential, pathbreaking ideas capable of shaping and changing the lives of many is needed to
multiply one’s startup or company in the market of commercial technology. Ideas as wild as self
driving cars, fully automated raw material to finished good producing systems, internet of things,
artificial intelligence, and various others are finding their way in the reality. With them is seen
development of associated technologies, in shape and form of hardware and softwares driving
them. The interesting fact is not just such technologies are coming up but them coming up not
from the conventional multinationals or think tanks but from commoners, startups or small time
innovators, developers. Their ideas and innovations are recognised worldwide, their contribution
to introduce newer and better systems and improve the existing systems is also appreciated.
However for them to grow in order to change the world with the revolutionary ideas and
technology they create needs a showcase stage to give them the spotlight on a universal scale 
they deserve and need. Just like the world religious parliament which was held in Chicago in the
previous century became the centre stage for Swami Vivekananda, he was able to showcase to
the world the talent and calibre he possess. Had the parliament not been organised Vivekananda
might not have been a worldwide renowned figure today. Similar stage for technology showcase
and promotion of associated businesses is done by the renowned ‘Consumer Technology
Association’ or the CTA whose landmark event CES(Consumer Electronics Show) conducted
annually becomes the forum of interaction and showcase of technologies from around the globe.
The innovators meet entrepreneurs, technocrats intermingle with business outsourcers for their
mutual benefit and providing something better to the world. The stage provides not just business
promotion but help inculcate basic technological skills in business specialists and basic business,
outsourcing skills to the technologists, innovators. Making the specialists generalise and the
generalists specialise through getting to them the much needed exposure. Just like Zuckerberg
got through the Facemash experiment in Harvard and Steve Jobs got public dealing experience in
the small garage out there in the silicon valley. If these multi billion dollar conglomerates had such
a minuscule start taking them to the highs they are at now, one can just imagine if a startup in its
initial stages get an exposure on such a grand scale, the push it will get might just take it straight
among the stars.
India especially needs such a stage to showcase the talent pool available to it and the
demographic advantage it has to provide quick, cheap, skilled technical labour available with it.
The biggest drawback in the Indian education system is the lack of research and development
taken up in the universities. Barring few top institutions the much needed industrial education and
skill development also misses out from the education checklist in India. CTA and its research and
standards forum can help in a big way. Students and future technocrats can use the services to
make themselves better in the respective research fields, get the proper skill set to make them
more employable in the industry. CTA not just discuss about the present technologies but the
future prospects of the industry, one the paper available with the association describes the future
aspects of technologies like artificial intelligence, answering the questions of the students and
researchers to step in the field or not for instance.
Ideas get promoted and businesses make fortune out of the forums like CES.
The latest CES-2018 to be organised in the gambling city of Las Vegas can prove to be the
biggest bets in the lives of various entrepreneurs, techies and innovators. CES has various themes
such as advertisement and entertainment, automative, health and wellness, home and family,
internet of things, product design and manufacturing, robotics and machine intelligence, sports
and associated startups sects. CES attracted around 4000 companies to its floor in the previous
versions under the banner of International Consumer Electronics Show. The trade associated with
the event is a mind boggling 292 billion USD on the face. The platform was the birthplace of
various technologies brought to us like CD(compact disk, 1991), Tabs, Notebooks, Android all in
the year 2010, blue ray, DVD, 4K HDTV and various other state of the art systems which today
makes up an inseparable part of our lives. What all one needs is a membership of the CTA, which
can prove to be a one way ticket to prosperity and business in the field.
What India should learn is that the industrial growth is an important step for the growth of the
nation and its economy. USA became the world super power, major contributors to its power are
such forums only. Having an international approach towards technology in essential spice to the
dish of economic completeness. India tried to become one such platform but only after 1991 with
the LPG reforms it took up post disintegration of the USSR. However the government policies
largely remained conservative and tariff barriers stringent, becoming hurdle for true competition.
Saving the domestic companies from the foreign firms was the rationale behind these steps. But
the policy makers simply ignored the economists of the time in order to save the vote bank, as
economics theory places true competition not as hurdle but an inspiration for firms to innovate
and rise above. Giving up the traditional aspect of protectionism is what Indian industries need.
CES promotes the companies from all over the world. USA placing least barriers in order to
promote incoming of talent and innovations on its soil. India must also promote associations like
CTA and events as CES. The previous decade proved a small progress towards the same. Under
the banner of Make in India initiative and Digital India government tried to achieve the same as
USA did in the last century. However political shadows remain in these programs as shown by the
reintroduction of long term capital gains tax, which might deter the incoming foreign capital in 
India. Manufacturing sector still awaits the growth which other developed countries, especially
China, capitalised and became world powers. Forums and enclaves are needed for India to get
the technological exposure and advancements which it desperately awaits, as technology is the
only solution to make the management of an ever-growing 125 crore population seamless and
free of chaos.
Some say technology may enslave the human population, artificial intelligence specifically, but
leaving aside the fiction (telephone was once a fiction only, but its a reality today, so its not wrong
to say that AI may end up doing what some speculate), the main focus and matter of concern is
the fact that technology takes away a huge chunk of conventional employment from the
population, which has majorly attributed to the jobless growth all around the world. But no one
can deny the fact that technology is as essential as fire to the human civilisation. Thus limiting
technology is a logical argument however consumer technology is as necessary as well. At least
for the coming century technology which revolves around goods and services provision would
remain a part of the economy and human civilisation. For technology is the gateway to prosperity
today, and one can only open up eyes in tomorrow only after surviving today. This idea further
legitimises the need of commercial technology forums like CTA(CES). Till technology is ethical,
moral, valued, useful, legitimate, within its boundary of making human life simpler, it will remain an
important aspect of our personal lives, economy.
