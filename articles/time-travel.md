There was a time in the past when we never thought of rockets going into space and carrying men to Moon. There was a time when the world of science knew about far less universes or galaxies than they do now and the idea of earth rotating on its axis was once unthinkable. Atom was once known as the smallest particle ever existed until a few decades back when electrons, neutrons and protons were discovered. But, in time, our renowned scientists discovered, explored and accomplished each of these achievements and much more. 

Time travel is another concept that has constantly kept the scientists on the edge of their seats. In layman terms, as the name suggests, Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine. There have been a ton of theories in the past explaining the dynamics of this idea, which generally include how it can be achieved or what might be the consequences of travelling in time. Time travel may seem fictional to a lot of people, but considering the boon that science has proved itself to be and the talented minds across the world working on it, it may soon be achievable in the near future. 

According to Albert Einstein, time is an illusion. It is relative which basically means it can vary for different observers depending on their speed through space. To Einstein, time is the fourth dimension and slows down or speeds up depending on how fast we move relative to some object.
Everybody is constantly travelling in time. Since the last year, I've moved forward one year and so have you. Another way to explain is that everybody travel in time at the speed of one hour per hour.

But the question arises; are we able to travel in time faster or slower than ‘1 hour per hour’? Or can we travel back in time, travelling at the rate, say two hours per hour, or 10/100 years per hour?
It is astonishing to think about time travel. What if we returned back in time and prevented our parents from meeting? We would prevent ourselves from ever having been born! But then if we hadn't been born, we could not have gone back in time to prevent them from the meeting. This defines the popular belief that the concept of changing the events in the past using time travel would affect the timeline of future and hence create an alternate timeline.

Most scientists agree to the fact that time travel to the past is impossible but the idea of Virtual time travel has allowed the world to create illusions of the past. Cutting edge augmented and virtual reality technologies have made attempts to synthesis real world phenomenon by digitally creating sites, monuments, artefacts and essentially a past within an interactive virtual environment.
Time travel to the past is unthinkable. The science for it is just incomprehensible. But we are confident that time travel into the future is going to a reality, as the required technology for it is beginning to take shape.
