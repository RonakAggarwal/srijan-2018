We never thought of computers, rockets and somewhere or sometimes that person will land on the moon, we can go in space, we can have satellites in space, we can have machines that can be sent to planets like Mars and we can visit other planets and find out some interesting facts about them like climate, atmosphere. We didn’t know about Universe and no. of Galaxies present in the universe. Above all, we didn’t even know before that Earth rotates. But we discovered, attained and accomplished everything, Science and great, renowned Scientists made it all possible. There have been theories about time travel too, about their existence and visiting time. Time travel or traveling in time may seem to be fiction to you. But in the world where there is a boon of science, time travel in coming times may soon be achievable. 
According to physicist Albert Einstein, time is an illusion. It is relative — it can vary for different observers depending on their speed through space. To Einstein, time is the fourth dimension. Time slows down or speeds up depending on how fast we move relative to some object.
We all are traveling in time. During the last year, I've moved forward one year and so have you. Another way to mention is that we travel in time at the speed of one hour per hour.
But the question arises; are we able to travel in time faster or slower than "1 hour per hour"? Or can we travel back in time, going back; say two hours per hour, or 10 or 100 years per hour? 
It is astonishing to think about time travel. What if we returned back in time and prevented our parents from meeting? We would prevent ourselves from ever having been born! But then if we hadn't been born, we could not have gone back in time to prevent them from the meeting.

A theory called Special Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein states that space and time are really aspects of the similar thing—space-time. There's a maximum speed limit of 300,000 kilometers per second (or 186,000 miles per second) for anything that travels through space-time, and light always travels at its speed limit through empty space.  Special Relativity also says that amazing thing happens when we move through space-time, especially when our speed relative to different objects is close to the speed of light. Time is going slower for us than for the people we left behind. We won't observe this effect until we return to those stationary people. 
Theory of Special Relativity gives rise to a concept of time dilation. In the idea of relativity, time dilation is a notable difference of elapsed time taken between two situations as assessed by observers either moving in accordance with the other person or in another way situated from a gravitational mass or masses.

Assume we are 15 years old when we left Earth in a spacecraft traveling at approximately 99.5% of the speed of light (which is much faster than what we can achieve now) and celebrated five birthdays during our space journey. When we get home at the age of 20, we would find that all our classmates were 65 years old, retired, and making the most of their grandchildren! Because time passed more slowly for us, we will have encountered only five years of life, while our classmates will have encountered an entire 50 years. 

Time travel also takes place for objects in gravitational fields. Einstein had another notable and exceptional theory called General Relativity, which envisage that time passes more steadily for objects in gravitational fields (like here on Earth) than for objects distant from such fields. As gravity is very intense near Black Holes and there are all kinds of space and time distortions close to black holes.  A Black hole is a region of space-time which exhibits strong gravitational effects that particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light, nothing can escape. The theory of general relativity also predicts that a dense mass can deform space-time to form a black hole.
In the past few years, some scientists have exercised those distortions in space-time to think of conceivable ways time machines can work. Some like the idea of "worm holes," which may be shortcuts through space-time. These ideas, only a conjecture, are based on good, solid science. 
One way to attain time travel into the future would be to travel at the speed of light in space, as initially theorized by Albert Einstein. The accepted theory is that one has to build a spaceship that can travel at the speed of light, and head out into space. 
Prof Greene: “When you step out of your ship, you’re one year older but Earth has gone through many, many years. “It can have gone through 10,000, 100,000 or a million years depending on how close to the speed of light you traveled.”
However, the main issue is that a machine which travels at such speed would require an unexpected amount of energy, while the stress from the centrifugal pressure on the body could possibly prove fatal. 
Einstein also theorized that if we situate ourselves on the edge of a black hole, time would pass more slowly.
Scientists and engineers overseeing space missions should account for the time distortions that occur by cause of General and Special Relativity. These effects are far too small to depend on most human terms or may be over a human lifetime. Even though, very tiny fractions of a second do matter for the precise work essential to fly spacecraft throughout the solar system.
Time travel to the past is unthinkable right now. The science for it is incomprehensible. I am confident time travel into the future is possible, as the technology it requires is beginning to take shape.
