# HEALTH SENSORS

Featuring Sleep Sensors

The future of medical care and technology is increasingly intersecting. 
The Future of healthcare and technology crossed path.

At CES 2018, sleep was one of the major topics in fitness technology. Initially “health tech” was mostly centered on step counters, digital workout coaches, and heart-rate trackers, in the form of wearable technology like Fitbit, Garmin, and Apple watch which track sleep based on movement, heart rate, and breathing patterns.

Smartwatches and fitness trackers have been using the principles of actigraphy: Monitoring your movements as you sleep with algorithms used to calculate your cycles. The less you move, the deeper the thinking goes, the deeper is your sleep. But not everyone wants to sleep wearing a band. The new trend is to use “contactless” devices that can be placed near your bed to allow them to analyse your sleeping patterns.

The lack of sleep is associated with health issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes and increased risk of heart attacks. 

CES, this year, was focused not only on tracking your sleep, but also on helping you to improve it. 
Some of the exhibited products are as follows.

Nokia Sleep: This Wi-Fi-enabled mat is placed under your mattress and gathers all kinds of information about your sleep. It deploys sensors and a mobile app to track heart rate, breathing patterns, how long you sleep, how restful your sleep was and your snoring patterns. Algorithms make sense of the sensor data to give you a sleep score, which in turn can provide recommendations on how to improve your sleep. It also features IFTTT and integrates with home automation devices, like dimming the lights as you sleep, or turning up the thermostat as you wake.
                            
Dreamlight sleep mask: It is a Bluetooth-connected sleep mask that covers your eyes and ears. It dims and illuminates light to match with your breathing and plays ambient sounds to block out the noise.
 
Somnox robot pillow: Somnox is a robot pillow that helps in regulating breathing pattern during sleep. It is equipped with various sensors. The somnox pillow can be felt as breathing when put on chest as you fall asleep. 

SleepScore Max, from a startup called SleepScore labs, is also a contactless solution but employs a device that sits on a nightstand. The companion app asks some questions about alcohol and caffeine consumption to gain more insight into variables that can affect sleep. Then the device uses bio movement analysis to determine quantity and quality of sleep, as well as monitors the environmental factors like temperature. 
It aggregates all these factors and applies a function to calculate a sleep score for the individual. This also helps in the analysis of sleep quality. The company aims to improve sleep patterns by 
recommending products around lighting, pillows, and sound therapy based on the individual’s personal sleep data.
 
The next wave of sleep gadgets is expected to hit the market shortly and is likely to include more sophisticated sleep-trackers that can monitor brain activity. At present, the brainwave patterns are thought to be the best indicators of sleep patterns.
