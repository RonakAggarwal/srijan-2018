“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” 
- Arthur C. Clarke

Technology is not buzzword-free, and it keeps on evolving. Taking a stroll in the outside world, we see everyone with phones, tablets, and laptops depending on the Internet for practically everything. Soon, the Internet of things will not be something we only read about; instead, it would be something that would be around us. 5G technology is being built with this in mind to connect everything to a network. 5G is not just a mobile technology which is going to impact virtually everything, it is pervasive access to high & low data rate services and is going to make practically everything wireless. But what is 5G? It is a wireless communication technology, next-generation mobile networks technology after 4G LTE networks. It is the final standard which will be set up by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and has the potential to change the world for the better. It'll affect the way we interact with wireless devices at the fundamental level, from our smartphone devices to the cars we drive, as well as the industries and societies. 5G is believed to be that technology which will make a lot of innovations possible over the next decade; its novelty is being compared to that of the introduction of electricity.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCED) Committee on Digital Economic Policy says that 5G technologies rollout will positively increase GDP, and improve employment opportunities and help in digitalization of the economy. It will offer far higher upload and download speed, and this new wireless technology will make the cloud systems to stream software updates, music. In short, it is going to push wireless boundaries so that you and your world stay connected.  It will help in the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence in our lives. It will also enable Smart devices to exchange data seamlessly providing the ecosystem for the Internet of Things (IoT).

India still lacks a substantial backhaul to transition to 5G. Presently, 80% of cell sites are connected through microwave backhaul, while under 20% sites are connected through a fiber. India has not adapted itself to 5G yet. Regulatory issues need to be revisited to overhaul the spectrum licensing regime, and 5G capable technology needs to be deployed on a large scale.

Although 5G was not a dominating topic in CES 2018, this is the technology which is bound to blur the line between wired broadband and wireless connections and will rule CES 2019. 5G will enhance data connectivity, improve security and increase the network size.
