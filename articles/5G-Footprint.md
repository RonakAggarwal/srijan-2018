“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
Technology is not buzzword-free and it keeps on evolving. Taking a stroll in the outside world, we see everyone with phones, tablets, and laptops depending on the Internet for practically everything. In no time soon, the Internet of things will not be something we think about, rather it would be something that would be around us. 5G technology is being built with this in mind to connect everything to a network. 5G is not just a mobile technology which is going to impact virtually everything, it is pervasive access to high & low data rate services and is going to make practically everything wireless. But what is 5G? It is a wireless communication technology, next-generation mobile networks technology after 4G LTE networks. The final standard will be set up by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) but it has the potential to completely change the way we interact with wireless devices, from the smartphones to the cars we drive and will transform industries and societies. 5G is believed to be that technology which will drive all the innovations over the next decade, its innovation is being compared to that of the introduction of electricity.

The OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) Committee on Digital Economic Policy, 5G technologies rollout will help to increase GDP, employment generation and help in digitalization of the economy. It will offer far greater upload and download speed and this new wireless technology will make the cloud systems to stream software updates, music. In short, it is going to push wireless boundaries so that you and your world stay connected.  It will help in the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence in our lives. It will also enable Smart devices to exchange data seamlessly providing the ecosystem for the Internet of Things (IoT).

India still lacks a strong backhaul to transition to 5G. Presently, 80% of cell sites are connected through microwave backhaul, while under 20% sites are connected through a fiber. India has not yet adapted itself completely 4G technology and it still needs time in order to evolve to experience an Artificial Intelligence revolution. Regulatory issues need to be revisited in order to overhaul the spectrum licensing regime and 5G capable technology needs to be deployed on a large scale.

Though 5G is not a dominant topic in CES 2018 but this technology which is bound to blur the line between wired broadband and wireless connections will definitely rule CES 2019. 5G will definitely enhance data connectivity, improve security and increase the network size.
