# 5G Footprint

“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”
Technology is not buzzword-free and it keeps on evolving. Taking a stroll on the outside world, we see everyone with phones, tablets and laptops depending on the Internet for practically everything. In no time soon, the Internet of things will not be something we think about, rather it would be something that would be around us. 5G technology is being built with this in mind to connect everything to a network. 5G is not just a mobile technology, it is ubiquitous access to high & low data rate services. It is a wireless communication technology, next generation mobile networks technology after 4G LTE networks. The final standard will be set up by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) but it has the potential to completely change the way we interact with wireless devices, from the smartphones in our pockets to the cars we drive.

The OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) Committee on Digital Economic Policy, 5G technologies rollout will help to increase GDP, employment generation and help in digitalisation of the economy. This will offer far greater upload and download speed than available today. This will help cloud systems to stream software updates, music, and navigation data.  It will help aid incorporation of Artificial Intelligence in our lives. It will also enable Smart devices to exchange data seamlessly providing the ecosystem for Internet of Things (IoT).


India still lacks a strong backhaul to transition to 5G. Presently, 80% of cell sites are connected through microwave backhaul, while under 20% sites are connected through fiber. India has not yet adapted itself completely 4G technology and it still needs time in order to evolve to experience an Artificial Intelligence revolution. Regulatory issues need to be revisited in order to overhaul the spectrum licensing regime and 5G capable technology needs to be deployed on a large scale.
