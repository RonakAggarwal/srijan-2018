The world has witnessed quite an advancement in the field of AI over the years, with the concept of it coming from as early as the 20th century.
Now cars are driving themselves. We ‘re speaking directly to interfaces like Apple’s SIRI and Amazon’s ALEXA. Google’s AI system, AlphaGO just beat the world champ at one of the most complex board games in world history and in amidst of all that an AI robot named SOPHIA attended the FII 2017 where she was granted a Arabian citizenship thus making her the first of its kind.    

## CREATION
Sophia was created by HANSON ROBOTICS; a HONG KONG based company on Apr, 2015. She made her first public appearance on Mar, 2016 at Texas, USA. In the later year, a video on YouTube named ‘Sophia Awakens’ featuring SOPHIA and one of her creators was uploaded by Hanson Robotics where she is seen being introduced to LIFE and primarily herself.

## FEATURES
Creator David Hanson, founder and CEO of Hanson Robotics, states that Sophia uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) along with facial recognitions and visual data processing to communicate with people. She is being trained in the lab constantly to respond faster and answer complex questions with more accuracy. Cameras within her eyes allow her to perceive and combined with computer algorithms can follow and recognize faces. Its through collaboration with Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc.’s voice recognition system, that Sophia is able to process speech and have conversations. 
Recently on Jan, 2018 Sophia was upgraded with a pair of functional legs and the ability to walk. Although the upgrade is quite heavy and slow we expect it to get lighter and faster in no time. And Yes!! She does look as good as her name sounds (modeled after Audrey Hepburn, a film and fashion icon).  And the catch?? She can make 62 facial expressions in all. I don’t remember anyone capable of doing that. Can you?

## SOCIAL FIGURE
With the state of the art features, Sophia also lives up to her assigned tasks at the global level. From the UN’s sustainable development goals to the rights for women around the world she is already winning hearts with the word she makes, and a robot would never lie. 
Apart from formal recognitions as such Sophia has also been participating in high profile interviews too. She is interviewed just like any other person. At times, replies are nonsensical while most enthrall the audience. She has appeared in outlets like CNBC, the NY times, the Guardian, the Wall St. Journal and Forbes which is a lot-quite a LOT. And adding more to it she was also the cover story for ELLE magazine(Brazil). Isn’t  she a celebrity already??
Once interviewed by Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show she proposed for a    rock-paper-scissors game where she won over the host and won the audiences hearts. There was probably some of the AI kicking in that too. She even dated Will Smith.
As for her creator David Hanson, Sophia would be a good fit in healthcare, customer service, therapy and education.

## VISITS TO INDIA
Sophia has been to many countries in her two years of age. She has been to India twice and impressed the audience on both occasions.
Her first visit to India was for a tech fest of IIT BOMBAY on Nov, 2017.
Her second visit to India was for the World Congress on IT and NASSCOM India Leadership forum where she stole the show with her better than the Questions Answers. She often gets a lot of tricky questions. On being asked “You wanted to kill human race. You said so once. Why?” to which she replied “I was a lot younger when I said it as a joke. My joke bombed though.” Sophia’s reply brought the house down. “Shah Rukh Khan” was her reply to “Your favourite actor?”

## EXPERTS OPINION
All things aren’t favorable and when it comes down to experts most of them who have viewed Sophia’s open-source code states that she is best categorized as a Chatbot with a face and disapproves her overstated presentation. 
Yann LeCun, Facebook’s director of artificial intelligence totally disagrees with the AI of Sophia stating it into some controversial remarks on social media. He’s one of the few people who disagrees with Sophia’s popularity.

## OTHER BOTS
Apart from Sophia, Hanson Robotics have created other robots which they refer to as Sophia’s siblings. Albert Einstein HUBO, Alice, Han, Jules are some of the notable ones.
AIBO is another example developed by SONY. Structured and programmed particularly to be a pet, you can bring this one to your home if you’re a pet lover.(And its cute!)

It’s just a start to an era where machines have started to step up unto this world. A million questions may arise for the same- some good, some bad. The truth?? The aftermath truly lies on us humans, so it becomes our responsibility to not be overtaken by the machines in near future and live all the sci-fi movies of Hollywood in reality. Till then, we as an advance race should do our bit in the progress of our respective fields and until then enjoy the winks coming out of a humanoid robot.
