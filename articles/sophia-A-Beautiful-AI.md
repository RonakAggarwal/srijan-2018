The world has witnessed quite an advancement in the field of AI over the years! We have seen the concept of driverless cars becoming a reality. Google’s AI system, AlphaGO just beat the world champ at one of the most complex board games in world history and in amidst of all this, an AI robot named SOPHIA, an alive machine, attended the FII 2017 where she was granted a Arabian citizenship thus, making her the first of its kind. 

## FEATURES
Sophia was created by HANSON ROBOTICS; a HONG KONG based company on Apr, 2015. She made her first public appearance in Mar, 2016 at Texas, USA. Creator David Hanson, founder and CEO of Hanson Robotics, states that Sophia uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) along with facial recognition and visual data processing to communicate with people. She is being trained in the lab constantly to respond faster and answer complex questions with more accuracy. Cameras within her eyes along with some computer algorithms enable her to perceive her surroundings and recognize faces. It is through its collaboration with Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc.’s voice recognition system, that Sophia is able to process speech and have conversations. 
In Jan, 2018 Sophia was upgraded with a pair of functional legs and the ability to walk. And that is not all, she can make 62 facial expressions in all. I don’t remember anyone capable of doing that. Can you?

## SOCIAL FIGURE
With the state of the art features, Sophia also lives up to her assigned tasks at the global level. She is already winning hearts with the word she makes, and a robot never lies. 
Sophia has also been participating in high profile interviews, and is being interviewed just like any other celebrity. At times, her replies are nonsensical while most of them, enthrall the audience. She has appeared in outlets like CNBC, the NY times, the Guardian, the Wall St. Journal and Forbes. And adding more to it, she was also the cover story for ELLE magazine(Brazil). Isn’t she a celebrity already?

Once interviewed by Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show she proposed for a rock-paper-scissors game where she won over the host and won the audiences' hearts. In March 2018, she even went on a date with Will Smith, and successfully friendzoned him when he tried to kiss her.

As per her creator David Hanson, Sophia would be a good fit in healthcare, customer service, therapy and education.
Sophia has been to many countries in her two years of age. She has been to India twice and impressed the audience on both these occasions. She often gets a lot of tricky questions. On being asked “You wanted to kill human race. You said so once. Why?” to which she replied “I was a lot younger when I said it as a joke. My joke bombed though.” Sophia’s reply brought the house down. “Shah Rukh Khan” was her reply to “Your favourite actor?”.

## EXPERTS OPINION
Things don't seem to be favorable when it comes down to experts. Most of them who have viewed Sophia’s open-source code, stated that she is best categorized as a Chatbot with a face and disapproved her overstated presentation. 
Yann LeCun, Facebook’s director of artificial intelligence, totally disagrees with the AI of Sophia and even passed some controversial remarks on social media. He’s one of the few people who disagrees with Sophia’s popularity.

## OTHER BOTS
Apart from Sophia, Hanson Robotics have created other robots which they refer to as Sophia’s siblings. Albert Einstein HUBO, Alice, Han, Jules are some of the notable ones. AIBO is another example developed by SONY. Structured and programmed particularly to be a pet, you can bring this one to your home if you’re a pet lover.

It’s just a start to an era where machines have started to step up unto this world. A million questions may arise for the same- some good, some bad. The aftermath truly lies on us humans, so it becomes our responsibility to not be overtaken by the machines in near future and live all the sci-fi movies of Hollywood in reality. Till then, we as an advance race, should do our bit in the progress of our respective fields and enjoy the winks coming out of a humanoid robot.
