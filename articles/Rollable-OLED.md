# That’s how they ROLL

Looking back at the time when CRTs were the weekly eye-treat to gander at in our school labs and then came those sleek TFTs, LEDs, LCDs that had us drooling over their space consumption, followed by the surrealistic Curved Screens leaving a little to our imagination. Skipping over a few generations of technology improvements from then, let’s talk about the present day screens where HD has improved to 4k and soon 8k, bezel-less and transparency are customary, aspect ratio is a fluid term and 32 inches is … Oh, is it there yet? 
The good old Idiot box is now smarter than ever, connecting smart-home devices, taking voice commands, doubling as a gaming console and catering virtual assisting. There isn’t really a lot left to differentiate their functionality from other tech gadgets or phones and computers per se. 
What better a place to savour the current developments in tech than the CES! For the TV conference that CES has become, it wasn’t unlikely to confront a plethora of big tech brands presenting their new super high-resolution TV. While some companies were boasting crazy pixel resolutions and smart Home features, others explored a little with the big screen dimensions. The 7680×4320 pixel combination is doomed to become the new standard that we will use every day on all our devices. And yes, if you wonder, your eyes will see the difference!
##Samsung's "The Wall"
Billed as the world’s first “modular TV”, the company claims that its display can be built to a user-demanded custom size. This mammoth of a display measures a whopping 146 inches making it one of the largest TVs to be unveiled at CES 2018. The Wall 4K TV uses Micro LEDs that give it a few picture-quality advantages over OLED TVs such as greater brightness, better contrast, more vibrant colours, and reduced burn-in. That said, The Wall also wasn’t the highest resolution or thinnest of TVs to be seen.
##LG 65-inch roll-able OLED TV
So we started with round TVs, struggling to get them flat, just to end up with curved screens all over again? Well this one’s a tad more than that. The 65-inch 4K OLED TV curves when it’s (not) needed and rolls away into a tidy box roughly 12 inches deep, doubling as a speaker. It is also not restricted to a 16:9 aspect ratio and with the press of a button, could be contracted to watch those wide screen 21:9 movies without the letterboxing (the bothering black bars) or as a low-profile information display with weather, music and other controls. 
It still awaits a timeline for the commercial availability and a possible price tag which is not that hard to be imagined of. Its sci-fi movie design also aids to the portability and easy storage of the TV. It is quite easily the first 65 inch HDTV that you can carry around under your arms or in the backseat of your car without disrupting your view!
##LG's 'OLED Canyon'
Termed as the amusement ride of CES 18 by tech reporters, the canyon experience is a follow up to LG's extremely successful "OLED Tunnel" that premiered at CES 2016. The Canyon is a 92-foot-long pathway of displays made up of over 240 LG OLED 4K TVs and that is quite the zenith to leave you contemplating!

Thus, these rollable TVs of tomorrow will turn invisible when not in use and these are an advancement in technology that is indistinguishable from magic.
